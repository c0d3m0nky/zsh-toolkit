# zsh-toolkit
A collection of bash & python scripts I use as helpers in zsh

# Install
```zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c0d3m0nky/zsh-toolkit/main/install.sh)"```

# ToDo
* Include extra scripts
  * Test shell includes
  * Figure out how to handle python includes and document
* Self update
  * ~~Manual~~
  * Scheduled
* Separate and cache of heuristics
* Troubleshoot and optimize load times
* Why is pipx not updating on "source $ZSHCOM/init.sh" after update and requires ssh reconnect?
